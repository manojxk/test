| **Unit Testing**            | Testing individual components or modules of a software to ensure they function correctly. | Testing a single function or method in a class.                |
| **Integration Testing**     | Testing the interaction between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected. | Testing the data flow between two modules.                     |
| **Regression Testing**      | Testing existing software functionalities to ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected them. | Running a suite of tests on a new software release.            |
| **Performance Testing**     | Testing to determine the responsiveness, stability, scalability, and speed of an application under a particular workload. | Measuring how fast a website loads under various user conditions. |
| **Acceptance Testing**      | Testing conducted to determine if the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment. | User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by end users.                    |
| **Sanity Testing**          | Brief testing of major functionalities to determine if a particular function or bug is fixed and works correctly. | Checking if a newly added feature works as intended.           |
| **Vulnerability Assessment**| Testing to identify, quantify, and prioritize the vulnerabilities in a system. | Scanning a web application for security weaknesses.            |
