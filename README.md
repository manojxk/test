| **HTTP Status Code** | **Definition**                                                  | **Example**                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **200 OK**           | The request has succeeded.                                      | A GET request to `/api/users` returns a list of users.        |
| **201 Created**      | The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. | A POST request to `/api/users` successfully creates a new user. |
| **204 No Content**   | The server has successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. | A DELETE request to `/api/users/123` successfully deletes the user, but no content is returned. |
| **400 Bad Request**  | The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. | A POST request to `/api/users` with invalid data format.      |
| **401 Unauthorized** | The request requires user authentication.                       | A GET request to `/api/secure-data` without proper authentication headers. |
| **403 Forbidden**    | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it. | A user without the necessary permissions attempts to access `/api/admin`. |
| **404 Not Found**    | The server can't find the requested resource.                   | A GET request to `/api/nonexistent-endpoint`.                 |
| **405 Method Not Allowed** | The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. | A POST request to `/api/users/123` where only GET and DELETE are allowed. |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. | A GET request to `/api/users` results in an error due to a bug in the server code. |
| **502 Bad Gateway**  | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server. | A GET request to `/api/data` is routed through a gateway that encounters an invalid response from an upstream server. |
| **503 Service Unavailable** | The server is not ready to handle the request, usually due to maintenance or overload. | A GET request to `/api/service` during a server maintenance period. |
